This repository contains map files and data for the Spatial Module BENV0093 academic year 20/21

Contains the relevant files to play with the location and energy data in R and QGIS. The folder will be updated with new data and GIS analysis.

QGIS
The data/files that you need is located under the folder data\QGIS. The project file that calls for the different layers is called Group_map.qgz.

As a reminder, the raster and vector layer should be located in the same folder as the project file. If not, you will need to locate each of the layers manually.

R
The data is located under the folder data\R.

The python notebook file is located under the analysis folder with the name Interactive Mapping.ipynb. We have been experiencing some issues with the script so it is highly recommended that you copy and paste the code lines into your R environment and recreate the map.
